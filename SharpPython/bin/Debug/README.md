# Colortex
Colortex is a script, created to produce textually built images. 

Before conversion, all images are downscaled using the scale factor, by default it's 6 
(width and height will be divided by 6). Additional tweaking is available through filenames.
Be aware that on conversion stage each pixel of the source image will be replaced with 16x16px 
character. Improper selection of the scale factor consequently results in a huge output image. 
Usually, the best result is achieved on factor near 6, but the optimal value should be selected 
individually for each image. Be aware that output images tend to be large. Long gif animation 
might take a few hundreds of megabytes.

<b>Folders:</b><br>
*input* - Source files. Accepted types: bmp, png, jpg and gif.<br>

*used* - Processed files are to move into this folder.<br>

<b>Parameters:</b><br>

"[3] some file.png" - downscale using factor 3 instead of default 6<br>
"[5-10] some file.png" - generate separate images for scale factors from 5 to 10 (inclusive)
